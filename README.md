# Gesture Controlled Robotic Arm

Prototype 1 of a basic gesture controlled robotic arm. Part of a series to create a robotic assisted surgery suite.

Project and code adapted from Eben Kouao's Arduino Robotic Arm - Controlled by Hand Gestures project

Semi custom library adapted from Krodal's singlefile code

CAD files adapted from LimpSquid's project series: [Thingiverse Link](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1750025/files)

## TODO
- Need to update circuit diagrams (MPU6050 SCL and SDA should be connected to A4 and A5)
- Test the custom library on the Nano
